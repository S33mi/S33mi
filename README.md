## Hi there 👋


Data enthusiast and researcher | Turning past work into open, reproducible projects  

"Just trying to do great things" — one simulation, notebook, and optimization at a time.



### 🔧 Background & Key Projects

- **IoT Routing Simulations** — RPL-based experiments in Contiki-Cooja (energy, latency analysis, modified code & setups) → [iot-routing-contiki](https://github.com/S33mi/iot-routing-contiki) (BSD-3-Clause)

- **Intelligent 2D Packing Optimization** — Heuristics & metaheuristics (Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Cuckoo Search, NFP, Bottom-Left-Fill) for irregular nesting → [intelligent-optimization](https://github.com/S33mi/intelligent-optimization) (MIT)

- **English & Turkish Grammar Notes** — Personal handwritten PDFs 📚 for tenses, cases, structures & differences (self-study fun) → [English-and-Turkish-Language-Grammar-Notes](https://github.com/S33mi/English-and-Turkish-Language-Grammar-Notes) 😅 (MIT)

- **Paper Reimplementations** — Previously reimplemented research papers during my PhD. Starting with DataPrep.EDA EDA tools → [paper-reimplementations](https://github.com/S33mi/paper-reimplementations) (MIT)

- **Credit Fraud Analytics** — Analysis of credit card transaction data for fraud detection using anomaly detection techniques → [credit-fraud-analytics](https://github.com/S33mi/credit-fraud-analytics) (MIT)

- **Climate & Sustainable Cities** — Data explorations on environmental trends and urban sustainability → [climate-sustainable-cities](https://github.com/S33mi/climate-urban-sustainability) 🌱 (MIT)

- **Know Your Style** — Fashion-MNIST EDA + CNN classification (~90-92% accuracy) → [know-your-style](https://github.com/S33mi/know-your-style) (MIT)

- **Daily Motivation + Tennis Tips Agent** — Fun Python agent with free quotes API & tennis tips → [daily-motivation-tennis-fun](https://github.com/S33mi/daily-motivation-tennis-fun) (MIT)


More coming soon: JP Morgan python training for Bussiness Analysts, more on paper reimplementations, and data analysis notebooks.
